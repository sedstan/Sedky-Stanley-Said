                    I am an ambitious Frontend developer with a fondness for any
                    progressive framework looking to move into a frontend role
                    that uses Vue or React. In my previous tenure, I have gained
                    an eye for detail through the use of semantic HTML, CSS BEM
                    methodologies and components when using progressive
                    frameworks. I’m seeking a role with a team of developers I
                    can learn from whilst providing my knowledge and skillsets
                    to others.

                    Upon arrival to the UK in 2014, I worked as photographer
                    assistant and video camera operator whilst working toward a
                    career in tech.

                    Prior to working in the UK, I worked as a retail employee

                    station.
