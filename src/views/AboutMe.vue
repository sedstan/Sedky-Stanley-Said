                    I am an ambitious web developer striving for pixel
                    perfection. In my previous tenure, I gained an eye for
                    detail using semantic HTML, CSS BEM methodologies and
                    JavaScript. Iâ€™m seeking a role with a team of developers I
                    can learn from whilst providing my knowledge and skillsets
                    to others.

                    Upon arrival to the UK in 2014, I worked as photographer
                    assistant and video camera operator whilst working toward a
                    career in tech.

                    Prior to working in the UK, I worked as a retail employee
                    and video camera operator for a local government television
                    station.
